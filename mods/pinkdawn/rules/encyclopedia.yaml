        Description: Engineers are used to capture enemy buildings. Since they carry no weapons, they are extremely vulnerable on the battlefield and must be directed very carefully. These infantry are very slow, so loading them into an APC is an ideal way to move them about the battlefield.\nA common tactic involving Engineers is to load a group of them into a Transport Helicopter and fly them to the enemy base to capture unguarded structures.\nAnother capability of the Engineers is, due to their expert knowledge of structural integrity, to repair damaged structures at what appears to be an instant by simply entering them.\nEngineers are also capable of repairing destroyed bridges, or restoring husks of structures to operational capacity.\n\nThe Defense Corps branch of the Allies enjoys cheaper deployment costs of the engineers, perhaps due to extensive support of the best educational facilities in the free European land.
