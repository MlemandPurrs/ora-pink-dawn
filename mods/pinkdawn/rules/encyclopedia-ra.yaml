Without it, you cannot build any new structures.\n\nThe Construction Yard is fairly strong, but as with almost all structures, it is vulnerable to Engineers. Try surrounding your Construction Yard with walls to keep out unwanted guests.

This version has sacrificed some power in order to become man-portable, its still capable of zapping infantry in one-shot however.\nThe weapon was proponent of a discovery made in the field, as it has been determined the device can be used to empower a tesla coil when it had lost power. Since then, soviet commanders have been able to use this tactic for keeping their tesla coils up and running in case of a power failure.\n\nThe Shock Division among the Soviet forces is, perhaps unsurprisingly, capable of training Shock Troopers at a discount rate due the influx of new recruits.
