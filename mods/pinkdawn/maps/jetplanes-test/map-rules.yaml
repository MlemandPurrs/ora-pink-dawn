		Briefing: -Jet Planes Test-\nAirports are able to build a ground-attack jet plane.\nJets can be selected when on ground and given a order to airstrike.\nCredits:\n*Unit art by Nolt

#   how i'd like them get used:
#   While on Airfield, can only be given:
#   1. Order to attack, will fly there and execute command until ammo depleted, then return to assigned Airfield for resupply.
#   2. Order to relocate to another Airfield.
#   3. Guard command, which will make it fly to area and use Anti-Air missiles (NYI)
#   While the Jet is on Air, can only be given order to Stop, which makes it return to it's assigned Airfield.
#   It would reject any order else. You wont able to select Jet mid-air to give a new target, nor able to order it to move somewhere.
#   Pretty much the unit can only be commanded while its on the Airfield be the result.
